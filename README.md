LOLRPG has been designed as a submission for the April/May 2016 Riot Games API challenge.

# Philosophy

We wanted to build LOLRPG using nothing but native browser functionality. Not only this, but we also wanted LOLRPG to
be built using html for display rather than using a canvas element. This choice was made in order to make LOLRPG as
accessible as possible through nearly any device that supports html.

We wanted LOLRPG to maintain as much of the spirit or essence of League of Legends as possible, and hopefully
anyone who has played League of Legends and plays LOLRPG will feel right at home there. Our interface was designed to
mimic League of Legend's own, with a twist of it's own personality in order to adhere to it's requirements.

Finally we wanted to make sure that LOLRPG was accessible to not just League of Legends regular players, but anyone who
wanted to try it. LOLRPG's 'Use Free To Play Champion' option allows anyone, even those who do not have (or do not know)
a summoner name, to play LOLRPG. Meanwhile we also wanted to improve and expand a user's experience within LOLRPG based
on their summoner mastery stats in League of Legends.
